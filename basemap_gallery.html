  <!-- Q1.1: The output of this task is a street map of Los Angeles and its surrounding suburban areas with textured land features, city/town labels, and highway symbols. -->
  <!-- Q2.1: The output after adding the Transportation Layer is of the same Los Angeles area but with translucent labels, a textured coastal area, and more focus on the streets of the California region.-->
  <!-- Q2.2: The output of this task is a night mode map of Los Angeles that still features the same extent of the location and same variables with some style changes to the symbols and labels. There are also points added around the city. -->
